# Quick start data science project template

### About The Project
The notebook was create to enable a quick start with the data science project. It contains some visualization, preprocessing, data mining and model creation patterns. The project was inspired by the project checklist from "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems" book by Aurelien Geron. It contains slightly modified projeck check list with basic implementation.

###

I created an example of template usage. It presents a solution to kaggle titanic competition.
You can try it by running example notebook

### Notes

1. I used a picture from sckit learn documentation to present some useful models. The link to the picture is here https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html.
